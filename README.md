Project completed in order to show mastery of Firebase, cloud storage mechanics, and moment.js.

The web app allows users to input train information via a bootstrap form. Inputs are sent to a database in Firebase which is then pulled to create HTML lines in the schedule table as well as calculate time to next arrival.
